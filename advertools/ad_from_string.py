    """Convert string `s` to an ad by splitting it into groups of words.
    Each group would have a length of at most the allowed length for that slot. 
    
    If the total length of `s` exceeds the total allowed length, all remaining
    characters would be grouped in the last element of the returned list.
    
    Main ad slots:
    
    Headline 1: 30 chars
    Headline 2: 30 chars
    Description: 80 chars
    Path1: 15 chars
    Path2: 15 chars
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    s : a string of characters, with no restrictions on length.
    capitalize : whether or not to capitalize each word after grouping. Setting 
        it as False would leave the input string as is. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    text ad : a list of strings 
    
    Examples
    --------

    >>> ad_from_string('this is a longer ad and would take two of the first slots')
